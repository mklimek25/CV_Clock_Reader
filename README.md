# Data Centralization-Visualization-Tool
Welcome to my first project as a programmer. Named Eagle Eye, I generated a series of programs to collect data from production forms and store data from specific cells into a SQL database. 
From there, I generated another program on plotly dash that visualized the data using plotly dash.

The first program that had to be built was 'Combination db' which took all excel production forms and feeds them to a SQLite database.

All of this data is then pulled by a GUI created on plotly dash. This GUI presents the user with a variety of data visualization options. Results can also be exported into an excel file.
